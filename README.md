# PaintBrush
Demo of Paint Application in Windows

This is my first graphics project. In this project i am using inbilt functions of graphics and in this project i have simply made a layout of paint brush i have use 2 viewports 1st viewport is only for showing the colors and symbols and outlook of page and in second viewport we can draw circle rectangle bar or any line dots and we can also add texture and we can use different colors as per given colors.

Because of less time i cant make my project like autocad actually i want to make my project like autocad but for now this is simply paint brush where we can draw color and we can have fun with this in leisure  time.

Moreover this is project is fully graphics based so all codes and coding are done by all graphics function  and i also use mouse i.e. my built header file.

In mouse function i have copied the code from internet and made a header file. Rest all will we have when we will use it.
